# Hi! I'm Grace.
I recently earned a B.S. in data science at the University of Rochester. I'm interested in machine learning, data science, and using tools from those fields to work on solving social problems.

Outside of data science, I enjoy reading (check out [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/grace_gr8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for a data scientist's dream reading tracker), soccer (both playing and spectating), and painting.

I'm currently looking to start my career in data science, and am excited to share my explorations of the intersection between data science, social problems, and other areas through this website!
