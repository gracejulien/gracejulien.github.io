## About
I recently completed my data science degree at the University of Rochester (B.S. Data Science), with a concentration in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, and minors in mathematics and studio arts.

Raised in Akron, Ohio, I remember math and problem solving as a constant in my life, even as far back as elementary school, when I would ask my dad to give me numbers to multiply together as fast as I could in the backseat on our way home each night. Since then, I’ve followed the excitement and sense of achievement I felt solving problems in the backseat to data science and machine learning experiences at Corning, Inc., and in research at U of R. I’m interested in all things machine learning and AI, and in using them to address social inequities.

I've spent the last few years working on small projects with [my dad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylejulien/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an urban planner and economic development professional, on school breaks, using my skills as a data scientist to solve the unique problems he faces in urban planning. I'm excited to continue working on social problems, particularly in urban environments, in my career.

I created this website to share my explorations of the intersection between data science, social inequities, and other fields.
