I recently finished my data science degree at the University of Rochester, finishing with a concentration in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, and minors in mathematics and studio art.

Raised in Akron, Ohio, by an urban planner and a nurse, I grew up wandering the city with an eye for walkability and architecture, JDSKJF LONG BEFORE I COULD EVEN PRONOUNCE THE TWO. My dad would give me projects to work on as he drove, everything from multiplying large numbers together as fast as I could to keeping track of billboard usage in different neighborhoods. 

Raised in Akron, Ohio, I remember math and problem solving as a constant in my life, even as far back as elementary school, when I would ask my dad to give me numbers to multiply together as fast as I could in the backseat on our way home each night. Since then, I’ve followed the excitement and sense of achievement I felt solving problems in the backseat to data science and machine learning experiences at Corning, Inc. and in the Grossfield Lab at URMC. I’m interested in all things machine learning and AI, and in using them to solve new and old problems alike.
