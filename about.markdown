## About
I recently completed my data science degree at the University of Rochester (B.S. Data Science), with a concentration in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, and minors in mathematics and studio arts.

Raised in Akron, Ohio, I remember math and problem solving as a constant in my life, even as far back as elementary school, when I would ask my dad to give me numbers to multiply together as fast as I could in the backseat on our way home each night. Since then, I’ve followed the excitement and sense of achievement I felt solving problems in the backseat to data science and machine learning experiences at Corning, Inc., and in research at U of R. I’m interested in all things machine learning and AI, and in using them to address social inequities.

I've spent the last few years working on small projects with my dad, an urban planner, on school breaks, bringing my skills as a data scientist to solve the unique problems he faces in urban planning. I'm excited to continue working on social problems, particularly in urban environments, in my future career.

I created this website to share my explorations of the intersection between data science and social problems.
